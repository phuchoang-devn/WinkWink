# 😉 WinkWink

WinkWink is a university project built with **Node.js** and **React**.  
It is a simple **dating application** developed to learn how to build an HTTP server with Node.js and practice frontend development with React. 🧡💜♥️💚

The main goal of this project was educational: understanding full-stack architecture, client–server communication, and real-time features in a modern web application.
